# Python-Stuff
Various Python scripts I wrote to learn the language and fulfill some tasks


[Chapter List File](chapter_list_file.py)<br>
Creating list of html tags if website orders chapters by number


[Find Duplicate Numbers In File](DuplicateNumInFileSearch.py)<br>
Helpful to see if any chapters were duplicated 


[Eye Safety](eyeSafety.py)<br>
Using Windows 10 Toast Notifications, reminds to refresh your eyes every 20 minutes for two minutes


[Sun Checker](SunChecker.py)<br>
An experiment in website crawling, gets information about sunset and sunrise times and displays as Toast Notification
(Useful because I didn't know you could schedule the blue screen filter / flux, and without a window I'd lose track of time)


[Website Parser](websiteParse.py)<br>
Allows for getting chapter title if not in header of page, and also outputs full chapter list to a file

## Technologies
